# Decentralized Vending Machine

## Introduction:
The decentralized vending machine project is a cutting-edge application that brings together blockchain technology and smart contracts to create an innovative way of purchasing snacks. This vending machine allows users to buy snacks like pizza, donuts, potato chips (lays), and drinks using cryptocurrency (ETH) as payment. The project not only fetches real-time prices through a Chainlink node (Aggregator) but also provides real-time balance monitoring of the available snack items within the vending machine. Additionally, the project includes a mechanism for the owner to withdraw funds from the contract.

## Features:

### Item Selection:
Users can interact with the decentralized vending machine and select from a range of snacks, including pizza, donuts, lays, and drinks. Each item has a specific price in Ether (ETH).

### Real-Time Pricing:
The vending machine fetches real-time prices of the items through a Chainlink node (Aggregator), ensuring accurate and up-to-date pricing.

### Secure Transactions:
The project uses smart contracts to handle transactions. When a user selects an item and initiates a purchase, the contract automatically calculates the required amount of ETH based on the item's price.

### Real-Time Balance Monitoring:
The vending machine's interface displays the real-time balances of each snack item available for purchase. This information is pulled directly from the smart contract, reflecting the current inventory status.

### Payment with Cryptocurrency:
Users can pay for their selected items using Ether (ETH). The smart contract verifies the payment and processes the vending once the transaction is confirmed.

### Owner Withdrawal:
The owner of the vending machine contract has the ability to withdraw accumulated funds. This feature incentivizes the owner to manage and operate the vending machine.

### User-Friendly Interface:
The project includes a user-friendly web interface where users can see the available items, their ETH prices, real-time balances, and make selections.

### Transparency and Immunity:
All transactions and interactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

# Workflow:

### User Interaction:
Users access the vending machine's web interface, where they can view available snacks, their prices in ETH, and real-time balances.

### Item Selection and Payment:
Users choose their desired snack and start the purchase process. The smart contract calculates the required ETH amount based on the selected item's price.

### Transaction Processing:
Once the user confirms the transaction, the smart contract validates the payment and proceeds with the vending process.

### Vending and Balance Update:
The vending process confirms the successful transaction and dispenses the chosen snack. Simultaneously, the smart contract updates the balance of the purchased item.

### Owner Withdrawal:
The contract owner can access the management interface to withdraw funds collected from purchases.

# Benefits:

### Decentralization:
The vending machine operates on the blockchain, eliminating intermediaries.

### Transparency: 
Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
### Real-Time Information:
Real-time balance monitoring keeps users informed about available snacks.
### Cryptocurrency Use: 
The project demonstrates the practical application of cryptocurrencies.
### Automated Transactions: 
Smart contracts automate the buying process, minimizing errors.
# Conclusion:
The decentralized vending machine project exemplifies blockchain's potential in creating secure, transparent, and automated systems. By allowing users to buy snacks using cryptocurrency and continuously updating real-time balances, the project revolutionizes the vending industry. It establishes a bridge between the digital and physical realms, laying the groundwork for a decentralized economy with endless possibilities.
